This is an example of how to build and depliy apps with Codex by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

   


## Tools I used building this
- [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/) for auto-generating code
- [Stenography](https://stenography.dev) for explaining the auto-generated code
- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) for deploying
